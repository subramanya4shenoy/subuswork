            Each image contains what does the group of that species is called, also the image implies the meaning. \
            He used canva for creating quick immages, fonts and convertion. You can search the project \
            response with above hashtag in insta, if you love them, share them <3',
            extra_desription_detailed: '<p>The whole idea of this project was to create a minimal design with tools available \
                                        on smart phones. The design holds the animal theme. Each text in the design describes what \
                                        that perticular speciese of group of animals is called.</p> </br> \
                                        <p> I started with <b>Murder :</b> A group of crows is called as a murder, The red color \
                                        background implies blood, or some thing ghore, the font used was support its purpose. </p> </br> \
                                        <b>School :</b> A group of fish is called a school, hence I added multiple fishesh moving \
                                        in one direction, the colors yellow and black is used to get a touch of school bus \
                                        (or a taxi) </p> </br> <p><b>Pride :</b> this means group of lions. Although I have used \
                                        only one lion in the image, supporting with a text with a fullstop. This implies the \
                                        musculanity of the animal. also to convey that the pride of this animal doen\'t relie on its \
                                        number. this image was created using only triangle, pentagon and hexagon shapes. \
                                        Background color choosen is to reflect its nature</p> </br> <p><b>Flamboyance :</b> Group of \
                                        flemingoes are flamboyance. Hence used the curvy text, which also, indecates the curvy necks\
                                        of the bird, the color also indecates the color of the bird.</p> </br> <p>\
                                        <b>Parade :</b> This is quiet a common word, this describes elephants marching in group. \
                                        background used was ivory color, and The text Parade was put in a box to indicate the symetry and\
                                        tight patttern just like a army marching or parading. </p> </br> <p> <b>Swarm :</b>\
                                        This indicates group of bees (or birds). The pointed triangles which are floaking around \
                                        shows the pattern of bees flying, the pointed triangles are used to replicate \
                                        the pointed stings of bees, yellow and black are the common color pattern of bees\
                                        </p> </br><p>The whole project was created during my commute to office, tools used \
                                        were only canva. I used only the materials available in canva.',
